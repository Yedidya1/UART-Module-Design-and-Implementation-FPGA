UART Communication Interface - Design and Implementation over FPGA:

This project involved designing and implementing a UART communication interface using FPGA and VHDL. I developed the interface, 
transmitter and receiver, from scratch, enabling reliable serial data exchange between the FPGA and other UART-compatible systems.

Achievements and Goals:

The project aimed to establish a bidirectional communication link for seamless data exchange. I developed custom VHDL code to address
practical challenges like button debouncing and precise timing control, ensuring the system's reliability and accuracy.

Project Development:

In order to achieve precise data exchange and reliable interfacing with other UART entities, I integrated various blocks, including clock
dividers, state machines, counters, and debouncing circuits, into a unified top module with VHDL and Vivado environments for design and 
simulation, and Nexys A7 FPGA board for implementation.

Personal Experience and Learning:

This project enhanced my skills of:
- Digital design (while considering practical issues like delays and button bouncing)
- VHDL programming
- System vrification and validation
- FPGA development 

Overcoming challeges such as debugging and adapting the design to the FPGA's constraints strengthened my problem-solving skills and attention
to details. The hands-on experience deepened my passion for hardware design.

Conclusion:

This rewarding experience solidified my skills in hardware design and digital communication systems.
